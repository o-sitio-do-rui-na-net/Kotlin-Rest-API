# Kotlin-Rest-API

this was a coding challange for interview

the objetive was to consume a an api and list books






this was done over the knee in a couple of hours, with very little knowledge on API consumption and JSON data

we can say that this is an example of a singleton aplication, since its requirements/funcinalities are very simple.


however this show my capability to adapt and find solution to things that on that time i didnt even knew what they meant/used
